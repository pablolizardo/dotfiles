# Inkscape Open Symbols
**Symbol libraries are sets of SVG symbols located in one SVG document.** For the more technical audience, inkscape search for any valid SVG file with symbols (```<symbol>``` element) in your system configuration directory (typically ```share/inkscape```)

Inkscape 0.91 includes five example libraries: logic symbols, AIGA/DOT transportation symbols, map symbols, flow chart shapes and word balloons made by Martin Owens and Tavmjong Bah.

## How do I install them?

1. Grab the icon libraries you need **cloning the repo** or **downloading the ZIP**. You can also save the SVG files to your system directly from github.
2. Copy the individual SVG files into your inkscape share directoy (typically ```share/inkscape```) under the ```symbols``` folder. If it's not there, create it.
  - For OS X and Linux, the local user directory is `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`.
  - For Windows, the directory is:
    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Inkscape\share\symbols`. (64 bits)
	- `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Inkscape\share\symbols`. (32 bits) 
3. Launch Inkscape (close it first if it's already running).
4. Open Symbols from ```Object > symbols``` or press ```Ctrl+Shift+Y```. You should see all the Material Design Icons sets as well as Octicons in the "Symbol set" dropdown.

Available in Arch Linux and derivated through AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/inkscape-open-symbols-git/

## How can I request new symbols?

Please fill a issue and provide a SVG reference. If available and well created, it will be fast to generate.

## Why not doing it from the UI?
It is perfectly fine to use the inkscape UI for library development, but they won't be as useful for developers as if it is well generated, minimized and packed for use in production development in some cases.
**Some icons need to be SVG processed in order to be fully useful for both for designers and developers.**

**If you don't need to use it for web development you can watch this cool UI creation video**: [Creating symbol libraries in Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdaGB0zCdHw)
